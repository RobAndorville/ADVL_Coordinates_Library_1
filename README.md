The Andorville™ Coordinates Library is used by the Andorville™ Coordinates application.
It contains classes used to store geodetic and projected coordinate parameters and to convert between coordinate systems. The library is designed to be compatible with data from the EPSG geodetic parameter dataset.
This dataset can be found at http://www.epsg.org/EPSGhome.aspx
